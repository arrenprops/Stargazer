# Stargazer
## Description
Stargazer is a one stop shop for stargazing needs. Stargazer connects to your location via google maps and shows current weather and light pollution data. The app shows a map of the sky according to your coordinates so you can see what you are looking at through your telescope. The site also connects to flickr, so if you find a star you're curious about you can look at a gallery of it in the photo section.

## Technologies Used
Stargazer was created using the following languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AngularJS
- JQuery
- WebAPI

Stargazer uses the following APIs
- Google Maps
- Flickr
- Wunderground
- Sky-Maps.Org

## Planning And Approach
The first step to creating my app was wireframing the design of the website to fit the end goal, arranging the maps and information to fit the flow of the product. The seond task was to gain access to the APIs and make sure that they would return the information I was looking for. Once I completed those tasks it wasn't long until I filled in the gaps to build the finished app.
